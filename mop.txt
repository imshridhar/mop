Okay, this is an excellent, comprehensive specification! Let's structure this into Frontend, Backend, and Database sections to guide the development of your MOP application, integrating the commenting feature throughout.

MOP: Manufacturing Operations Platform
Motto: "Digitize Your Manufacturing, Effortlessly."
Core Vision: To provide small-scale Indian manufacturing units with an affordable, intuitive, and powerful digital tool to streamline operations, enhance visibility, and drive efficiency across multiple factories and owners.

I. Overall Architecture & Design Philosophy

Dashboard Status: Green (Good), Yellow (Warning), Red (Alert/Stopped), Blue (Idle).

Real-time: WebSockets (Socket.IO) for instant updates.

Modularity: Independent yet interconnected components/modules.

Responsiveness: Desktop/tablet and mobile-friendly primary for dashboards; for Supervisor/Worker/Client different dashboard or interfaces.

III. Backend Development (Node.js, Express.js)

A. API Design (RESTful Endpoints)

Structure endpoints logically by resource (e.g., /api/v1/users, /api/v1/factories, /api/v1/work-orders, /api/v1/inventory/raw-materials, /api/v1/machines/:machineId/downtime, /api/v1/comments).

Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Consistent request/response formats (JSON).

Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering for list endpoints.

B. Authentication & Authorization (RBAC)

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

/auth/register/owner, /auth/register/client, /auth/login endpoints.

Token generation upon successful login/registration.

Token validation middleware for protected routes.

Authorization (RBAC):

Middleware to check user role (Admin(create manualy id and password), Owner, Supervisor, Worker, Client) and permissions for accessing specific routes or performing actions.

Permissions logic: e.g., Only Owner/Supervisor can create WOs. Only Owner can create Supervisor accounts.

C. Real-time Communication (Socket.IO)

Setup Socket.IO server.

Emit events for:

Live Production Dashboard updates (WO status changes, line status, output metrics).

Inventory level changes (triggering frontend alert displays).

Machine status changes.

New critical alerts.

New comment notifications (optional for Phase 2/3, targeted to involved users).

Use rooms for targeting updates (e.g., factory_<factoryId>_dashboard, workorder_<woId>_comments).

D. Module-Specific Backend Logic:

User & Factory Management:

CRUD operations for Users (all roles), Factories.

Logic for linking Owners to Factories, Supervisors to Factories, Workers to Factories.

Password hashing (bcrypt).

Admin logic for factory data setup.

Live Production Dashboard Logic:

Aggregate data from Work Orders, Machines, Labor for the selected factory/lines/shift.

Calculate KPIs like OEE (if implemented), output deviations.

Process filter requests.

Smart Work Order System Logic:

CRUD for Work Orders.

Generate unique WO IDs.

Business logic for status transitions, history logging.

Linkage to Product master (for BOM), Inventory (for material allocation), Machines, Workers.

(Simple) Completion time estimation logic (standard time per unit * quantity). Future: factor in load.

Bottleneck detection logic (e.g., if WO status is "Paused - Material Shortage").

Inventory Tracker Logic:

CRUD for Raw Materials master, Finished Goods.

GRN processing: Update stock, log transaction.

Consumption logic: Decrement stock against WO, log transaction.

Dispatch logic: Decrement FG stock, log dispatch.

Scrap logging: Record scrap entries.

Reorder/Minimum stock level checks and alert generation.

Machine & Labor Utilization Logic:

CRUD for Machine master.

Log machine downtime: record start/end, calculate duration, store root cause.

Calculate uptime/OEE components.

Worker shift assignment logic.

(Basic) Productivity tracking: link worker activity to WO task completion.

Alert generation for idle machines/workers, over-utilization.

Insights & Analytics Panel Logic:

Data aggregation and calculation for KPIs (On-Time Delivery, Wastage %, Output, Uptime, etc.).

Data fetching based on filters.

Report generation (PDF/Excel):

Use libraries like pdfmake or puppeteer (for HTML to PDF) for PDFs.

Use libraries like exceljs or xlsx for Excel.

(Simple) Predictive trend lines: Linear regression on historical data.

Commenting Feature Backend Logic:

Endpoints:

POST /api/v1/comments: Create a new comment. Requires entity_type (e.g., 'production_line', 'work_order', 'raw_material', 'downtime_log'), entity_id, and content.

GET /api/v1/comments?entity_type=<type>&entity_id=<id>: Get all comments for a specific entity.

PUT /api/v1/comments/:commentId: Edit own comment (check ownership and timeframe).

DELETE /api/v1/comments/:commentId: Delete own comment (check ownership).

Logic:

Validate user role (Owner/Supervisor can comment).

Store commenter's ID and role with the comment.

Ensure comments are only visible to Owners/Supervisors associated with the same factory as the commented entity.

(Optional for Phase 2/3) Notification logic: When a comment is added, identify relevant users (e.g., other supervisors/owner of the same factory, or users "watching" an item) and create a notification entry for them / emit a socket event.

E. Key Feature Backend Implementation:

Voice Input Processing:

Endpoint to receive transcribed text from frontend.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) - can start with simple keyword matching/regex, or use a lightweight NLP library if more complexity is needed.

Examples: "start order {ID}" -> find WO, update status. "check stock {material name}" -> query inventory. "log downtime machine {ID} reason {reason}" -> create downtime entry.

Execute corresponding actions based on parsed command.

QR-Code Based Operations Logic:

Endpoints to receive data identified by QR scans (e.g., material SKU, WO ID, machine ID).

Process this data to pre-fill forms or directly log actions (e.g., POST /api/inventory/consume-via-qr with workOrderId and materialSku).

QR Code Generation: Library like qrcode to generate QR codes for materials, machines, etc., to be stored/displayed.

Multi-Factory Dashboard Logic:

Data aggregation queries that can group by factory for Owners viewing multiple factories.

Ensuring data is properly scoped by factory ID for all operations.

Downtime Root-Cause Tracker:

Manage a list of pre-defined and custom root causes.

Link downtime logs to these causes.

Analytics endpoints to get frequency of root causes.

Invoice Generation & Email:

Endpoint to trigger invoice generation for a Work Order (or batch).

Fetch WO details, client details, product pricing.

Use a PDF generation library (pdfmake or similar) with a template.

Use an email service/library (Nodemailer with SMTP or transactional email service like SendGrid/Mailgun) to send the PDF invoice to the client's email.

Implement appropriate Indexes on frequently queried columns (FKs, date ranges, status fields, entity_type and entity_id in Comments).

Use transactions for operations that involve multiple table updates (e.g., Work Order creation, Inventory consumption).

Consider partitioning for very large tables if performance becomes an issue over time (e.g., InventoryTransactions, MachineDowntimeLogs).

This detailed breakdown should serve as a strong foundation for building MOP. Remember to iterate, especially on the UI/UX, based on feedback and usability testing. Good luck!
